  <a class="anchor" name="Overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
  <a class="anchor" name="Scope"><h3>Scope</h3></a>
  JMLR seeks previously unpublished papers on machine learning that contain:
<ul>
  <li>
    new principled algorithms with sound empirical validation, and with
    justification of theoretical, psychological, or biological nature;
  </li>
  <li>
    experimental and/or theoretical studies yielding new insight into the design
    and behavior of learning in intelligent systems;
  </li>
  <li>
    formalization of new learning tasks (e.g., in the context of new
    applications) and of methods for assessing performance on those tasks;
  </li>
  <li>
    development of new analytical frameworks that advance theoretical studies of
    practical learning methods.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
JMLR publishes papers on the theory and methods of machine learning but does not publish 
applications of machine learning to other domains. JMLR favors papers of interest to a broader 
machine learning audience and may deem a paper unsuitable if the editorial board finds its audience 
too narrow. JMLR occasionally publishes surveys by invitation from the editorial board; we do not 
consider unsolicited survey papers.
</p>
<p>
JMLR does not allow simultaneous submission to conferences or other journals.
</p>
  <h3>
  <a class="anchor" name="Content">Content</a>
  </h3>
  Papers must be concise and complete; manuscripts should be carefully proofread
  and polished. Submissions that do not meet these criteria may be returned
  unreviewed.
  <p>
    All claims should be clearly articulated and supported either by empirical
    experiments or theoretical analyses. When appropriate, authors are encouraged
    to implement their work and to demonstrate its utility on significant
    problems; any experiments reported should be reproducible. Papers describing
    systems should clearly describe the contributions or the principles underlying
    the system. Papers describing theoretical results should also discuss their
    practical utility. In general, it should be clear how the work advances the
    current state of understanding and why the advance matters. Papers should
    report on what was learned in doing the work, rather than merely on what was
    done.
  </p>
  <p>
    Authors must clearly acknowledge the contributions of their predecessors, and
    situate their submission in the context of the broader machine learning
    research literature. If a paper introduces new terminology or techniques, it
    should also explain why current terminology or techniques are insufficient.
  </p>
  <h3>
  <a class="anchor" name="Originality">Originality</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
    Submissions to JMLR cannot have been published previously in any other
    journal. We will consider submissions that have been published at workshops or
    conferences. In these cases, we expect the JMLR submission to cite the prior
    work, go into much greater depth and to extend the published results in a
    substantive way. In all cases, authors must notify JMLR about previous
    publication at the time of submission, attach the previous paper as a
    supplementary document, and explain the differences from their prior work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Examples of (possibly) acceptable 'deltas' beyond a conference paper include:
    new theoretical results, entirely new application domains, significant new
    insights and/or analyses. Examples of insufficient deltas include: adding
    proofs that were omitted from a conference paper; minor variations or
    extensions of previous experiments; adding extra background material or
    references. However, we ultimately leave the decision about whether a 'delta'
    is significant enough up to the individual reviewers.
  </p>
<p>Currently, JMLR does not publish review articles.</p>
<p> JMLR has a strict policy against plagiarism.

 When there is an accusation of plagiarism, JMLR takes the following steps.

<ul>
  <li> JMLR asks the accuser to clearly document the plagiarism.
  <li> JMLR sends the documentation to the accused authors for a response.
  <li> JMLR reviews the accusation and the response, possibly in
  consultation with other experts in the relevant fields, and makes a
  determination.
</ul>

<p> If JMLR determines that there has been plagiarism, the paper is
  retracted (or rejected, if it is a manuscript). JMLR may take
  additional steps, such as (but not necessarily limited to)
  contacting the program chairs of the major machine learning
  conferences, contacting the editors of other journals, contacting
  the places of employment of the accused authors, and rejecting other
  manuscripts under submission to JMLR by the same authors.
  <h3><a class="anchor" name="Preprints">Preprints</a></h3>
  <p>
    Authors may submit work to JMLR that is already available as a preprint, for
    example on arXiV or personal websites.
  </p>
  <h3><a class="anchor" name="Disclosure">Disclosure of Funding</a></h3>
  <p>
  Please identify any Funding and Conflicts of Interest that fall into the following categories:
  </p>
  <h4>Funding (financial activities supporting the submitted work):</h4>
  <p>In order to pursue the work that you submitted to JMLR, did any of the authors receive third party funding or third party support during the last 36 months prior to this submission? This question refers to any aspect of the submitted work, including but not limited to personal funding, data collection, data evaluation, computing hardware, cloud computing services, or programming support. Examples could be grants by a government agency, stipends or donations by a commercial sponsor, a private foundation or a charity.</p>
  <p>Please list all such funding sources.</p>
  <p>Example: Funding in direct support of this work: NSF grant XXX, GPUs donated by YYY, scholarship by Company ZZZ.</p>

  <h4>Competing Interests (financial activities outside the submitted work):</h4>
  <p>Did any of the authors have financial relationships with entities that could potentially be perceived to influence what you wrote in the submitted work, during the last 36 months prior to this submission? You should disclose interactions with any entity that could be considered broadly relevant to the work, even if the funding was not used to support the submitted work, and regardless of the amount of compensation. Examples could be engagements with commercial companies or startups (sabbaticals, employments, stipends), honorariums, donations of hardware or cloud computing services.</p>
  <p>Please list all sources of revenue paid or promised to be paid.</p>
  <p>Example: Additional revenues related to this work: Sabbatical at Company Y; Part time employment with Company Z; Honorarium for lectures by Charity X; Honorarium as Member of the Advisory Board of Startup C; Travel support by Foundation A; hardware donations by Company B.</p>

  The list of authors provided at initial submission is deemed final
  for the duration of peer review.  Requests to add, remove, or
  reorder authors are not permitted during this period, except in
  rare, well-justified circumstances (e.g., administrative error,
  authorship dispute resolution).  If an exceptional situation arises,
  the corresponding author must email the Editorial Office before a
  final decision is rendered, supplying (i) a detailed rationale, and
  (ii) written consent from all current and proposed authors.
  Approval is at the sole discretion of the Editor-in-Chiefs.
